# About Kajianku

The vacuum of time when doing activities at home opens up more space for other activities such as following studies. The amount of information on Islamic studies circulating on social media can be the right answer in fulfilling the existing interests of this community. However, the large amount of information circulating is not accompanied by regularity and completeness of information for study enthusiasts. This inspired us what if there was an information channel that contained information about various studies both online and offline to make it easier for people to organize their time and plan the studies they would like to attend. In addition, they do not bother to find studies that are spread across various social media and they can easily find studies that match the theme they want.
